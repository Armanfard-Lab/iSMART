- title: "Cross-Task Affinity Learning for Multitask Dense Scene Predictions"
  image: ctal_site.jpg
  description: In this paper, we introduce the Cross-Task Affinity Learning (CTAL) module, a lightweight framework that enhances task refinement in multitask networks. CTAL effectively captures local and long-range cross-task interactions by optimizing task affinity matrices for parameter-efficient grouped convolutions without concern for information loss. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art MTL performance for both CNN and transformer backbones, using significantly fewer parameters than single-task learning.
